It is also highly advisable to use a `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ for your project.

.. note::
    For more info please visit https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

If you are using a venv please refer to `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ on how to activate it.

To install FerrisWheel you can type the following command

.. code-block:: bash
